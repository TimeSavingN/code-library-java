# REST API Test by REST Client Plugin on VS Code


### /httpRequestParams

### GET

GET http://localhost:9000/servlet-basic-the-request/httpRequestParams?name=Get HTTP/1.1

### POST 1
### if the POST data is encoded as key-value pairs of content type: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" like when you use a standard HTML form.

POST http://localhost:9000/servlet-basic-the-request/httpRequestParams HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=Post by form

### POST 2 
### If you use a different encoding schema for your post data, as in your case when you post a json data stream, you need to use a custom decoder that can process the raw datastream from:
### BufferedReader reader = request.getReader();

POST http://localhost:9000/servlet-basic-the-request/httpRequestParams HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{"name":"Post by json"}

###

PUT http://localhost:9000/servlet-basic-the-request/httpRequestParams?name=Put HTTP/1.1

###

PUT http://localhost:9000/servlet-basic-the-request/httpRequestParams?name=Delete HTTP/1.1
